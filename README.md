# 🚬 Smoking-Related Health Risk Analysis Across Vital Organs  
**Healthcare Analytics | Power BI | SQL | Data Storytelling**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the **systemic health impact of smoking** across vital organs — **lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, and overall body health** — using **SQL-driven analytics** and an **interactive Power BI dashboard**.

The goal is to move beyond surface-level smoking statistics and **quantify how smoking duration, intensity, and demographics contribute to organ-level damage and chronic health risks**.

This project serves as my **healthcare analytics capstone**, complementing my academic background in **Biochemistry** and my transition into **data analytics**.

## 🧬 Domain Relevance (Why This Matters)

Smoking affects the body **systemically**, not in isolation.  
By combining **biological insight** with **data analytics**, this project demonstrates:

- How **prolonged exposure** leads to cumulative organ damage
- Why **risk increases with age, duration, and daily intake**
- How smoking-related risks manifest differently across organs and genders

This mirrors **real-world healthcare analytics use cases** in:
- Preventive medicine
- Risk stratification
- Public health policy
- Clinical decision support

---

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights (Power BI)

### 🔹 Key Features
- **Organ-level navigation** (Heart, Liver, Lungs, Kidney, Full Body)
- **Healthy vs Damaged** condition toggle
- **Smoking status distribution** (Never, Current, Former)
- **Gender-based smoking patterns**
- **Age-group risk trends**
- **Cholesterol & Hypertension risk analysis**
- **Smoking duration vs daily cigarette intake**

### 🔹 Visual Design
- Health-risk color mapping (Green → Yellow → Red)
- Minimalist, medical-grade layout
- Insight-driven annotations (not just charts)

---

## 🧠 Key Insights from the Dashboard

- **Damaged cases consistently show longer smoking duration and higher daily intake**
- **Older age groups (49+) exhibit compounded health risks**, supporting cumulative exposure theory
- **Former smokers still carry elevated risks**, highlighting long-term physiological impact
- **Risk is systemic**, affecting multiple organs rather than being isolated to lungs alone
- **Male smoking prevalence is higher**, but female risk convergence increases with age

## 🗄️ Data & Tools Used

| Component | Tools |
|---------|------|
| Data Analysis | SQL (Aggregations, CASE, Window Functions) |
| Visualization | Power BI |
| Domain | Healthcare / Public Health |
| Concepts | Risk Scoring, Severity Classification, Cohort Analysis |

---

## 🧪 SQL-Driven Analytical Questions

The following **business and healthcare questions** were answered using SQL before visualization:

### 1️⃣ Which organs are most affected by smoking?
### 2️⃣ Distribution of smoking-related cases by organ?
### 3️⃣ Organ-wise severity comparison (High / Medium / Low risk)
### 4️⃣ Which organ contributes most to overall health risk?
### 5️⃣ Is smoking impact isolated or systemic?

## 🧩 Why This Project Stands Out

✔ Combines biomedical understanding + analytics
✔ Uses SQL for reasoning, not just data extraction
✔ Dashboards tell a clinical and public-health story
✔ Recruiter-friendly, insight-first approach
✔ Strong alignment with Healthcare Data Analyst / BI roles
